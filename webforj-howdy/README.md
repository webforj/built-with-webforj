# Howdy Application

The Howdy application is a web-based demonstration project built with WebforJ framework. It showcases how to create a
modern web application using Java, featuring a responsive user interface, Google Charts integration, and built-in
routing capabilities. This application serves as a practical example for developers learning WebforJ's core concepts and
best practices.


## Quick Start

1. Clone the repository
2. Run the application using Maven Jetty plugin:
   ```bash
   mvn jetty:run
   ```
   This command starts the application on port 8080. You can access it at http://localhost:8080

   The Jetty plugin is a servlet container that runs your web application locally for development and testing purposes.
